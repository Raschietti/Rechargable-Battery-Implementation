# Rechargable-Battery-Implementation
Solution to replace AAA batteries with Lithium Rechargable battery

# Issue
There are several devices I own that run o AA or AAA batteries that I need to buy from time to time, Yes I do know that exist AA or AAA batteries that are rechargable, but I cannot use the device until the battery is fully charged if I dont have spare ones to use.

# Solution
In this specific case I'm replacing a 3x AAA battery holder with a old cell phone Lithium battery and a USB Charger circuit (TP-4056) that has a output circuit that allow me to use the device while the battery is charing

# Attention
For implementing this solution be aware of the voltage levels and current consumption of your device, in my case a single battery cell is enough, but in other cases you may need some voltage regulation and protections to be implemented
